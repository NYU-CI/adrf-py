# adrf-py
ADRF Python Client Library

A python library for working with ADRF datasets.

This library makes it easy for ADRF users to pull and work with data stored on ADRF. Additionally, the library provides convenient wrappers for ADRF APIs, allowing users to create and update datasets, add and modify files, etc, and possibly implement entire apps on top of ADRF.
